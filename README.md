This project aims to assist logistic management in several aspects. One of these is the location of items in storage. To keep and locate the products, I created an addressing system that returns where and how many items of a specific code you have.

Furthermore, the system has built-in receiving and registration pages where you can register new products and receive them into storage. After receiving a product, you will need to take it to storage by transferring it from receiving to a specific address.

Another feature is the billing process. With it, you can simply upload invoices and see the entire process running. In the background, the billing extracts all relevant information from the invoices and sends it to the database. Once this happens, the picking process starts. This process sorts the products that will be sent to the final customer. After picking, the separation process takes place. This means you will select an invoice, and all the product information, location, and quantity will be displayed. In the end, when you separate the invoice, it will be automatically noted on the packing list or item relation.

Finally, beyond all this, you can also create a delivery route by going to the route tab and selecting the day and carrier you want.

Note: This project is a fictional scenario, and I do not have any credentials or authorization to use specific and valuable data resources. The goal of this project is to simulate a case. If you want, you can incorporate these features into what already exists or change them as you wish. This means that some important features, such as Federal Oversight Agency APIs or direct client orders, are not present here.****
